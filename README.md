## 📜 Project Description

I built my Wheel of Fortune Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Game allows you to spin a 🌈 colorful wheel with different prizes, and upon stopping, it reveals your prize. You can start a new game, spin the wheel, and end the game to collect your winnings.

## ✨ Features

- **Spin the Wheel:** Click the "Spin the wheel" button to start spinning the wheel and try your luck.
- **End the Game:** Click the "End the game" button to end the game and collect your winnings.
- **Random Prizes:** The wheel contains various prizes, and the result is determined randomly.
- **Responsive Design:** The game is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Difficulties and Problems

During the development of this project, some difficulties and problems were encountered:

1. **Managing Wheel Rotation:** One challenge was managing the rotation of the wheel to make it appear as if it's spinning realistically. This involved calculating random degrees for rotation and handling transitions.

2. **Index Calculation:** Calculating the prize based on the wheel's final resting position required careful calculation and indexing to map the degrees to specific prizes.

3. **Responsive Design:** Ensuring that the game worked well on different screen sizes and devices required responsive design adjustments.

4. **UI/UX:** Designing an appealing user interface and providing feedback to the user during the game to make it engaging and enjoyable.

5. **Error Handling:** Handling edge cases, such as attempting to end the game before spinning the wheel or clicking the spin button while the wheel is already spinning, required error handling and user prompts.

Despite these challenges, the project was successfully completed, providing an entertaining and interactive game for users to enjoy.
